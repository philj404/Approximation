# Approximation # 
An Approximation library for Arduino.

This library provides support for "coarse" numeric values.  These values track how many digits are significant.  Conversion to strings avoids showing distracting unimportant digits.

Approximations track their units.  For example values may be in "Volts" or "miles/gallon"

Output values also support engineering notation. They round the exponent to the nearest group of three.

### Example:
Include the library:
```cpp
#include <Approximation.h>
```

FIXME -- add more examples.
